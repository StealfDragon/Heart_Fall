Some good, most bad; all boney.\nPast couple hundred, maybe thousand years, it's been my job to take care of them; keep em' from killing anyone important.\nI've gotten too old for the job, so I'm passing it off to you.\nA strange magic haunts these walls.\nA dark, evil magic.\nThe only way to fend them off is to show them the light of love.\nDefeat them through amorous salvation. Cure them of their blight, and maybe you too can retire someday.\nOr, maybe you can fix this place once and for all...\nOr, maybe you'll just die.\nYou'd better get going. You'll need these.",
